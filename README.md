# Onsite-Procurement-Expansion
Adds 5 new characters to Take &amp; Hold for H3VR


Are you part of the weird niche of people who enjoy Onsite Procurement Patrice, and wish for a similar play style in Wieners Through Time? Or are you looking to get into Onsite Procurement, but need an easier character to try it out? Well, look no further! This mod features five brand new characters, following the default beginner, wild west, ww2, postwar, and modern progressions respectively:


Bonehead Billy

Aw, shoot! You completely left all of your equipment at home... a classic beginner mistake. Oh well, at least you strapped a combat knife to your belt so you'd never forget it.

-Currently spawns with a combat knife.


Farmhand Fiona

You used to be a simple farm girl, but that was before the bandits showed up. Unlucky for them, you know how to use farming equipment for more than just sowing seeds.

-Spawns with farming equipment.


Liberated Laura

The occupying forces think you're inferior. Think they can round you and your family up without resistance. Prove them wrong.

-Currently spawns with a combat knife.


Redneck Rodney

When it comes to red scare propaganda, you're a connoisseur. You drank up every bit uncritically, allowing yourself to be brainwashed until you reached a breaking point and went on an anti-soviet rampage. There's just one problem, though... You're too broke to buy a gun.

-Currently spawns with a combat knife.


Militia Mary

Your country is no nuclear superpower. You can't simply buy guns and ammo at every corner store. And now, more well established countries are taking advantage of this, to take your land and steal it's resources. But you're not going to let them, even if all you have to stop them is a knife.

-Currently spawns with a combat knife

# TODO

Futz with balance

Encryption spawn smoke seems to lie??? Possible bug, Gotta see if I can fix that.

# A WORD ON BALANCE
When I started this project, I wanted to avoid screwing with the balance as much as I could, since I figured Anton knew more about that than me. Well, turns out, not giving the player a gun at the start throws things out of whack. Who knew?

Patrice is balanced around the fact that even if the player is unable to get a gun from the item spawner (Which, in fact, is more often the case than not) the sosiguns are at least usable. With a few of the characters in my expansion, that isn't really the case. Fiona, for instance, only has access to Model95 sosiguns at the beginning, so if you don't get the opportunity to roll a single-action revolver, it's an uphill battle.

I'd like to remedy this situation, although I recognize there's some who'll always prefer the ways Anton himself balanced things. So, version 1.1 will be the last MAJOR update with these settings, while 1.2 and beyond will include my balance changes. However, bugs partaining to both versions will be fixed for BOTH VERSIONS. If you want to stick with Anton's balance, 1.1 will remain available on the github for this mod, and on Deli Counter.
